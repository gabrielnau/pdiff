# Pdiff (wip)

Tiny image diff utility wrapped around ImageMagick.

## Why ?

Wraith is ok, but as it, we can't use it in a test stack, it just outputs
image diffs.

## TODO

- handle IM command status code
- check for meaningfull options
- add a support for the pdiff binary


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'pdiff'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pdiff
